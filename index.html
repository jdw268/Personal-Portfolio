            <h2>About Me<div class="line-break"></div></h2>
            
            <p>Hi, <br><br>I am an engineer currently working in the industrial internet of things (IIOT) and augmented reality (AR) industries. I help design and build IIoT and AR applications as well as teach others how to do so too. These applications range from being used on mobile devices, large screens, or simply cloud-to-cloud communication and data transfer. My background is in electrical engineering - I started out designing large power systems. I liked it, but I wasn't passionate about it. I've always enjoyed tinkering and programming electronic devices. So it made sense to me to move to the software side and do more with monitoring and controlling devices programmatically and remotely. This passion then expanded beyond IIoT/AR applications and into the abyss of software development. Now, with extensive work-related and personal projects, programming bootcamps, and online courses, I've fully submerged myself into learning and developing software applications - ones used in the cloud, on a phone, or simply on my raspberry pi.
